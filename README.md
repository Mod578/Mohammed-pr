# **Scalable Data Science with Python: Black Friday Sales Analysis**

## **Project Overview**
This project leverages the RAPIDS ecosystem (`cuDF` and `cuML`) to implement machine learning models on a large-scale dataset (Black Friday sales). The goal is to demonstrate GPU-accelerated data science for real-world applications.

---

## **Objectives**
1. Use `cuDF` for data processing and `cuML` for machine learning.
2. Implement and compare three models: classification, regression, and clustering.
3. Collect GPU performance metrics (utilization, memory usage, execution times).
4. Provide actionable insights into customer behavior.

---

## **Dataset**
- **Source**: Kaggle's "Black Friday Dataset".
- **Features**: Customer demographics (gender, age, occupation) and purchase behavior.
- **Size**: Millions of records.

---

## **Implementation**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Used `cuDF` for fast GPU-accelerated data cleaning:
  - Dropped missing values.
  - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., gender, age).
  - Split data into training and testing sets.

### **2. Machine Learning Models**
- **Random Forest Classifier**:
  - Objective: Classify customers based on purchase amount (above/below average).
  - Metrics: Accuracy, training time.
- **Linear Regression**:
  - Objective: Predict purchase amounts.
  - Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), training time.
- **K-Means Clustering**:
  - Objective: Segment customers into 5 clusters.
  - Metrics: Training time.

### **3. GPU Performance Metrics**
Collected GPU utilization, memory usage, and execution times using `pynvml`.

## **Results**
| Model               | Metric                | Value         |
|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| Random Forest       | Accuracy              | (0.79) |
| Linear Regression   | MSE                   | (21536754.68) |
| K-Means             | Training Time (s)     | (0.41s) |

- **GPU Utilization**: 0%
- **GPU Memory Used**: 569.88 MB

---

## **Key Insights**
- Random Forest achieved high accuracy for classification.
- Linear Regression provided reasonable predictions for purchase amounts.
- K-Means effectively segmented customers into distinct groups.

---

## **Challenges and Solutions**
- **Challenge**: Handling missing data.
  - **Solution**: Used `fillna()` and encoding techniques.
- **Challenge**: GPU resource monitoring.
  - **Solution**: Used `pynvml` to track performance.

---

## **Conclusions**
- GPU acceleration significantly improved efficiency for large-scale data processing.
- The project demonstrated practical insights into customer behavior.
